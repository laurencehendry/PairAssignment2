Many crimes can happen every day in a major city, and fig-uring out which ones are committed by the same individualor group is an important and dicult data mining challenge.To do this, we propose a pattern detection algorithm calledSeries Finder, that grows a pattern of discovered crimes fromwithin a database, starting from a “seed” of a few crimes. Se-ries Finder incorporates both the common characteristics ofall patterns and the unique aspects of each specific pattern.We compared Series Finder with classic clustering and clas-sification models applied to crime analysis. It has promisingresults on a decade’s worth of crime pattern data from theCambridge Police Department.
