abstract = {Police analysts are required to unravel the complexities in data to assist operational personnel in arresting offenders and directing crime prevention strategies. However, the volume of crime that is being committed and the awareness of modern criminals make this a daunting task. The ability to analyse this amount of data with its inherent complexities without using computational support puts a strain on human resources. This paper examines the current techniques that are used to predict crime and criminality. Over time, these techniques have been refined and have achieved limited success. They are concentrated into three categories: statistical methods, these mainly relate to the journey to crime, age of offending and offending behaviour; techniques using geographical information systems that identify crime hot spots, repeat victimisation, crime attractors and crime generators; a miscellaneous group which includes machine learning techniques to identify patterns in criminal behaviour and studies involving re- offending. The majority of current techniques involve the prediction of either a single offender's criminality or a single crime type's next offence. These results are of only limited use in practical policing. It is our contention that Knowledge Discovery in Databases should be used on all crime types together with offender data, as a whole, to predict crime and criminality within a small geographical area of a police force.},

@article{Beckman2002a,
abstract = {According to the Annual Reports of the International Maritime Bureau on Piracy and Armed Robbery Against Ships for calendar years 1998, 1999, and 2000, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in waters in Southeast Asia, especially in the Malacca Strait and in Indonesian waters. Very few of the incidents in Southeast Asia are “piracy” as defined in international law because they took place in waters under the sovereignty of a coastal state. Nevertheless, many of the incidents posed serious threats to the safety of international maritime navigation. Some were offences under the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Acts Against the Safety of International Maritime Navigation. Some were also major criminal hijacks involving international organized crime. There has been considerable action at both the global and re- gional levels to attempt to deal with this threat to the safety of international naviga- tion. This article analyzes the reported incidents and the attempts by the interna- tional community to deal with the problem. The article concludes with various rec- ommendations on steps that should be taken by the international community and States in Southeast Asia to combat piracy and armed robbery against ships.},

abstract = {Transportation networks play a crucial role in human mobility, the exchange of goods and the spread of invasive species. With 90 per cent of world trade carried by sea, the global network of merchant ships provides one of the most important modes of transportation. Here, we use information about the itineraries of 16 363 cargo ships during the year 2007 to construct a network of links between ports. We show that the network has several features that set it apart from other transportation networks. In particular, most ships can be classified into three categories: bulk dry carriers, container ships and oil tankers. These three categories do not only differ in the ships' physical characteristics, but also in their mobility patterns and networks. Container ships follow regularly repeating paths whereas bulk dry carriers and oil tankers move less predictably between ports. The network of all ship movements possesses a heavy-tailed distribution for the connectivity of ports and for the loads transported on the links with systematic differences between ship types. The data analysed in this paper improve current assumptions based on gravity models of ship movements, an important step towards understanding patterns of global trade and bioinvasion.},

abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

abstract = {Allozyme variation of aspartate-aminotransferase locus Aat 1 is analysed in the land snail Cochlicopa lubrica (O. F. Muller, 1774). Two alleles, denoted '20' and '80', have been found in 29 Central European populations investigated. This species reproduces under a high rate of self-fertilization. Only three out of 787 individuals were heterozygous (enzyme pattern Aat 1 '20'/'80'). The homozygous individuals with Aat 1 '80' were frequent in moist and shady habitats. In exposed and open habitats, however, the homozygous individuals with Aat 1 '20' occurred frequently. These results give strong evidence for habitat-specific selection inferred from allozyme variation. Moreover, a tight interlocus correlation of isocitrate-dehydrogenase patterns (Idh 1) and Aat 1 patterns has been observed. Two groups of homozygous genotypes are commonly found: (1) the group Idh 1 '145'/Aat 1 '80', and (2) the group Idh 1 '155'/Aat 1 '20'. The Aat data for Cochlicopa lubrica are complemented by morphometric measurements of the shells. The homozygous types of Aat 1 '20' (common in exposed/open habitats) possessed, on average, slightly smaller shells than the homozygous types with Aat 1 '80' (common in moist/shady habitats). This slight mean difference in shell size might be due to the living conditions in the habitats. In the last part of the study, the allozyme variation of snails was assessed for spatial selection processes, and a compilation of the available papers is shown.},

(Peter C. Kiessler, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 102 (479), 2007) "The book is a well written self-contained textbook on measure and probability theory. It consists of 18 chapters. Every chapter contains many well chosen examples and ends with several problems related to the earlier developed theory (some with hints). a At the very end of the book there is an appendix collecting necessary facts from set theory, calculus and metric spaces. The authors suggest a few possibilities on how to use their book." (Kazimierz Musial, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1125 (2), 2008) "The title of the book consists of the names of its two basic parts. The booka (TM)s third part is comprised of some special topics from probability theory. a The authors suggest using the book intwo-semester graduate programs in statistics or a one-semester seminar on special topics. The material of the book is standard a is clear, comprehensive and a {\~{}}without being intimidatinga (TM)." (Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

abstract = {Our goal is to automatically detect patterns of crime. Among a large set of crimes that happen every year in a major city, it is challeng- ing, time-consuming, and labor-intensive for crime analysts to determine which ones may have been committed by the same individual(s). If auto- mated, data-driven tools for crime pattern detection are made available to assist analysts, these tools could help police to better understand pat- terns of crime, leading to more precise attribution of past crimes, and the apprehension of suspects. To do this, we propose a pattern detection algorithm called Series Finder, that grows a pattern of discovered crimes from within a database, starting from a “seed” of a few crimes. Series Finder incorporates both the common characteristics of all patterns and the unique aspects of each specific pattern, and has had promising re- sults on a decade’s worth of crime pattern data collected by the Crime Analysis Unit of the Cambridge Police Department.},

abstract = {Transportation networks play a crucial role in human mobility, the exchange of goods, and the spread of invasive species. With 90{\%} of world trade carried by sea, the global network of merchant ships provides one of the most important modes of transportation. Here we use information about the itineraries of 16,363 cargo ships during the year 2007 to construct a network of links between ports. We show that the network has several features which set it apart from other transportation networks. In particular, most ships can be classified in three categories: bulk dry carriers, container ships and oil tankers. These three categories do not only differ in the ships' physical characteristics, but also in their mobility patterns and networks. Container ships follow regularly repeating paths whereas bulk dry carriers and oil tankers move less predictably between ports. The network of all ship movements possesses a heavy-tailed distribution for the connectivity of ports and for the loads transported on the links with systematic differences between ship types. The data analyzed in this paper improve current assumptions based on gravity models of ship movements, an important step towards understanding patterns of global trade and bioinvasion.},

@article{Grover2007,
abstract = {Police analysts are required to unravel the complexities in data to assist operational personnel in arresting offenders and directing crime prevention strategies. However, the volume of crime that is being committed and the awareness of modern criminals make this a daunting task. The ability to analyse this amount of data with its inherent complexities without using computational support puts a strain on human resources. This paper examines the current techniques that are used to predict crime and criminality. Over time, these techniques have been refined and have achieved limited success. They are concentrated into three categories: statistical methods, these mainly relate to the journey to crime, age of offending and offending behaviour; techniques using geographical information systems that identify crime hot spots, repeat victimisation, crime attractors and crime generators; a miscellaneous group which includes machine learning techniques to identify patterns in criminal behaviour and studies involving re- offending. The majority of current techniques involve the prediction of either a single offender's criminality or a single crime type's next offence. These results are of only limited use in practical policing. It is our contention that Knowledge Discovery in Databases should be used on all crime types together with offender data, as a whole, to predict crime and criminality within a small geographical area of a police force.},
